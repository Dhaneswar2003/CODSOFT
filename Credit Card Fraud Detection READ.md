CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This repository contains the project I completed during my internship at CodSoft. The project focuses on building a machine-learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions.

Project Summary
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dataset: The dataset consists of anonymized credit card transactions, with features transformed using PCA. The data is highly imbalanced, with most transactions being non-fraudulent.

Objective: The goal is to create a model that accurately identifies fraudulent transactions, minimizing false positives and negatives.

Techniques Used: I implemented and evaluated several machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests. Among these, the Random Forest model provided the best performance.

How to Use
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the code to train the model and predict fraud:

bash
Copy code
python fraud_detection.py
Results
The final Random Forest model achieved high accuracy in detecting fraudulent transactions, making it a reliable tool for identifying potential credit card fraud.
